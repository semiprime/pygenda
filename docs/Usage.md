Pygenda usage
=============
Usage is intended to be intuitive, but a few things are worth noting:

* New entries can be created by starting to type a description.

* Pressing Enter on an existing entry edits that entry.

* **Primary navigation** is with the cursor keys (e.g. in Year View, the
  cursor keys move the cursor around the year grid; in dialogs, cursor
  keys move between widgets).
  **Secondary navigation** is with shift+cursor keys (e.g. in Year View,
  shift+up/down moves the second cursor between entries on the same
  day; in dialogs, shift+up/down possibly modifies the widget content,
  maybe by increasing/decreasing the value).

* In addition, date/time fields, spin buttons (GUI elements to enter a
  number), and comboboxes (choose option from dropdown list) can be
  increased with + or >, and decreased with - or <.

* The Escape key toggles between the most recent two views.

* In Week and Year views, the space key toggles between Today and
  wherever the cursor was last.

* Plus and minus keys will zoom in/out (no need for ctrl). The motivation
  for this is that on handheld devices, +/- might be require more than one
  key on their own, so adding another key would make zooming awkward.
  If you wish, you can disable this by setting the global/plus_minus_zoom
  config setting to False (ctrl+plus/minus will work in either case).

* The Zoom soft-button zooms in; shift+Zoom or ctrl+Zoom zooms out.

* You can set the number of zoom levels and the default with the zoom_levels
  and default_zoom config options. You can set the font sizes with custom CSS.

* If you want the Tab key to move within elements in date/time/duration
  widgets then set the global/tab_elts_datetime config option to True.

* Pressing y/m/d keys in date widget moves the cursor to year/month/day
  fields respectively. Similarly, pressing h/m keys in time or duration
  widget moves to hour/minute fields. (These shortcut keys are localised,
  for example in French they are a/m/j/h/m.)

* The icons in Year View are configurable via CSS. The default CSS
  shows a star for yearly events, a purple circle for monthly and weekly
  events, a yellow disc for other events, and a green "T" for Todos.
  Writing this CSS can be a bit fiddly, so a script, make_css_yearicons.py,
  is provided in the tools directory that generates the current icon
  CSS, and which can be modified to produce customised CSS.

* Hint: To convert To-dos into Events, or vice-versa, cut & paste them.

* In the "Notes" field in the Event and Todo dialogs, shift(or ctrl)+enter
  gives a new line (just enter will confirm the dialog).

* On a touchscreen, you can navigate by swiping left/right (Week View)
  or up/down (Year View).

* On Psion devices, Anniversaries were an entry type. On Pygenda,
  the same functionality is available by setting the repeat type
  of an event to "Anniversary".

* The UI for setting alarms is a placeholder, to test storage and
  activation of alarms (where testing is welcome).
  Keys:
    * +/>/-/< — move alarm time of the selected alarm forward/back;
    * N — new alarm;
    * Delete — delete selected alarm;
    * A/D/E — change action of selected alarm to Audio/Display/Email.
  For email alarms, you will need to set an email address in the
  config setting new_event/default_alarm_emailaddr.

* Sounding/displaying/sending alarms is the job of a different program:
  an alarm handler/server. Pygenda does not, and will not, activate the
  alarms. If you use Evolution Data Server to store your agenda then it
  might activate alarms, but you should test this (and test that alarms
  are activated if your device is in standby mode). Otherwise, it is
  likely that alarms will not be activated at all. (There is a warning
  in the UI about this because it's important that you understand that
  you need to do some setup or alarms will not be activated. You can
  get rid of the warning by changing the appropriate config setting to
  False.)
